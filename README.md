Two external libraries are used for the operation of the program. 
One library concerns the production of sales and supply charts, 
while the second concerns the regural operation of the base.

Thus,in order to avoid errors,
it is necessary to put in your programming environment (ex eclipse)
the two libraries that have been mentioned above.

The library that is used for the production of the charts is JFreeChart
and the .jar files of the this library are saved in the folder JFreeChartLib.
